# Euclidean-Manhattan-Distances

In this short mini project I show examples and comparisons of distance measures. Specifically, I visualized and compared the Euclidean distance to the Manhattan distance measures. The application of distance measures has a multitude of uses in data science and is the foundation of many algorithms I'll be using such as Prinical Components Analysis.
